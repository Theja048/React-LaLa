1.Emmet is a plug in for many text editors which greatly imporves html and css work flow;
here in this topics
we created "Hello world" program using *HTML *Javascript *React
adding React using CDN LINKS.
WHY? we can use react without downloading and installing anything in your local system.
 provides faster load times, optimized for quick content delivery and reducing the time 
 it takes to load for large and media rich web sites.
 inside cdn we have two links React development.js which is the 
 core library for building ui for  react applications.
 which provides functionality for defining and rendering components,
 handling user inputs and managing components states.
  and react dom is a package for integraton between for react and react dom.

  how we can creact H1 tags or any using react =>  React.createElement("h1");
  react need root where need all dom manipulation 
   ReactDOM.createRoot()
   how we put h1 tag in our root;
    root.render(h1)


    const head =  React.createElement
    ("h1",{id:"tittle"},"Hello world! using react");
    const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
     root.render(head);

     if we need nested tags just wrap them into an array
     const parent = React.createElement("div",{id:"parent"},
        [
        React.createElement("div",{id:"child"},
        [
        React.createElement("h1",{},"this is h1"),
        React.createElement("h2",{},"this is h2")],

        React.createElement("div",{id:"child"},
        [
        React.createElement("h3",{},"this is h1"),
        React.createElement("h4",{},"this is h2")]
        ))
        ])


        const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
        root.render(parent)
