IGNITE OUR app
npm is basically manages packages but not stand for node package manager.
package.Json is configuration for npm .
sometimes packages also known as dependencies.
webpack,parcel ->bundlers --> basically bundles our app which can make our app and push it to 
production

two types of dependency -> dev (developing our app) and general (production ready) dependency//

package-lock.json -> which keeps tracking the exact version or keeps the exact all record
to avoid habdling errors in production ready

 we hv used gitignore to ignore all regenerative stuffs like node_modules, parcel_caches,dist.....


 WE use parcel
// npx parcel index.html which will hosted in server.
it will hosted on port parcel is doing this.
npx -> we've npm -> we're calling the command 
npx->execute the package we use npx parcel index.html => to execute

we have seen one way in last time but now we are going to see another way 
because cdn is not a good way because keep updataing managing our react app we use install react app
as a package

now we have removed cdn because we dont need it we ve installed it

to build fast we use npx parcel build index.html
