previously we've used npx parcel .. stuff to run our project or website;
but its not a good way all time then we creacted npx script;
"npm start" for production dev "npm run build";

JSX : jsx is not html, it looks like html,
which is used to create React elements easily and readable;
also its not a part of react
JSX => transpiled before it reaches the js by parcel (manager) from babel (lib,package);
jsx transpiled react elements which creats an object and coverts to html when renders

Components: EveryThing in react is a component;
two types 
1) Class base component {old way}  normal js class
2) Function base component {new way} javascript functons

const Head = () =>{
    return <h1>Hello world</h1>
}
 const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
just wrap inside render
 root.render(<Head/>)

 when you wrap composing of two cmponents into one component
